Due to the trend of the Sharing Economy, the requirement for communal space has increased rapidly. But owing to the lacking of an Information match system, one who has spare rooms or resources can find it very difficult to construct a reservation system because of the technical threshold.

For the customer, their interest might be influenced by the deficient and limited information of the landlord's place. Our project's primary goal is to provide a general place-type reservation resolution with an opportunity for the landlord to create a reservation and management system quickly. With this opportunity, the landlord can not only construct their system rapidly but also provide sufficient information of the place to diminish the information asymmetry between the
landlord, the customer, and the government institution.

Our system provides a building secure, hygienic, Fire Control and violation review by using the open data. This kind of review can give credible information about the site for the customer to understand more and let the landlord keep enhancing the quality of their site and keeping up with the related regulations.
Our resolution also uses Google 720 degree street view to replace photos for presenting and booking the site. With the usage of the marker rather than only plain text to describe a location of a site. The site will be more concise and desirable for reservation and try to make the customer feel like they research the place right there by themselves.

This kind of transparency experience is to not only decreases the information asymmetry between the site and the customer but also provides a long-term booking relationship wherever and whenever they want.
